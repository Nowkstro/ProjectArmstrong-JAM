    {"BT": "Mr. Terry is you, I finally found you... My last memories are that we were being evacuated, and I was commanded by Miss Alice to find you..."},
    {"BT": "But I was hit in a protest that took place while the Armostrong-050 was launched"},
    {"BT": "My energy was weak and I was damaged, so the closest place was Miss Alice's house... I'm sorry Mr. Terry, I didn't reach you in time"},
    {"Terry": "Relax buddy, what matters is that I found you, could you play Aliciaâ€™s audio again, please?"},
    {"BT": "Yes sir, leave it to me"},
    {"BT": "BT, you need to find Terry"},
    {"BT": "I'll put plans on you for him to find another ship, Armstrong-032, it is a prototype, but Terry will know how to make it work, only this way he will be able to go to the W-01"},
    {"BT": "Say that I love him and that I am waiting for him"},
    {"Terry": "Thats all BT?"},
    {"BT": "Yes sir, and she left me the location of the ship and a password for you to be able to enter the location of the GSA where we were"},
    {"Terry": "Ok... I wish I had come here before"},
    {"Terry": "I couldn't come, it was difficult... Many memories... It's been five years since she went to that planet... I didn't think I would find you here buddy"},
    {"Terry": "Could you show me the location of the ship?"},
    {"BT": "Yes sir..."},
    {"BT": "Done, I sent it to your cell phone"},
    {"Terry": "..."},
    {"Terry": "I know where this is, is the GSA bunker, no one has been in there for a long time, it has all kinds of security"},
    {"BT": "I guess that's why Miss Alice left the password on me"},
    {"Terry": "Yes, expert girl... Come on BT, let's see where this will take us"},
    {"BT": "Yes sir!"},
    {"EOD": "EOD"}
