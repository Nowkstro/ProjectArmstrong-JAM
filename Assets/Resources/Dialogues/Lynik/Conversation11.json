{"Terry": "Today is BT, today is the time to get out of it!"},
{"BT": "That's it! Terry goes to the ship's location and meets Sonia."},
{"BT": "Good morning Miss Sonia!"},
{"Sonia": "Good morning BT.Terry ... "},
{"Terry": "... doctor ..."},
//Sonia starts to leave, turning her back on Terry
{"Terry": "doctor, I'm sorry for yesterday."},
{"Sonia": "Sonia turns around. Relax, you were tired ... But I didn't understand what you meant by sending my henchman..."},
//Mad appears and interrupts her.
{"Mad": "What's up, doctor, ready to get out of here? Terry, little robot, good morning gentlemen!"},
{"BT": "Good morning, Mr. Mad!"},
{"Sonia": "Oh, hi Mad, I think so, are we ready to install the last part Terry? This changes Terry's countenance instantly."},
{"Terry": "I think I was born for that, doctor! “Says smiling” Terry installs the last part of the missing ship."},
{"Terry": "Everyone can enter, I just have to make one last adjustment to the ship, it is done from the outside, I need to reset the ship so that everything is in compliance."},
{"Sonia": "But this is done outside the ship? Why not inside?"},
{"Terry": "Doctor, I didn't design this here ... I just built and fixed these bathtubs."},
{"Sonia": "I know idiot ..."},
{"Terry": "Well it's just a prototype, maybe in the version that went to planet W-01, this system is internal, who knows."},
{"Sonia": "It makes sense ... If I knew that when we built these ships, I would send the person in charge on the street right away ..."},
//And Sonia enters. Terry goes to the console on which he needs to reset.
